# capslock.vim

Press `<C-G>c` in insert mode to toggle a temporary software caps lock, or
`gC` in normal mode to toggle a slightly more permanent one.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-capslock.git
    vim -u NONE -c "helptags vim-capslock/doc" -c q

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help capslock`.
